=============

This is a weather dataset I collect in the northwest Boise area (approximately Pierce Park & Castle.) The first reading is from January 5 2014, with a granularity of 30 minutes.

I plan to add to it approximately every 3 months (every time the memory on the weather station fills), and may break it apart into monthly files after once the single file gets unwieldy.

Note the *Time* column is in m-d-yyyy h:mm format.
