=============

This is a weather dataset I collect in the northwest Boise area (approximately Pierce Park & Castle.) The first reading is from January 5 2014, with a granularity of 30 minutes.

I plan to add to it approximately every 3 months, and will break it apart into monthly files at that time.

Note the *Time* column is in DD-MM-YYYY format.
