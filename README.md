This is a weather dataset I collect in northwest Boise (Pierce Park & Castle.) The first reading is from January 5 2014, with a granularity of 30 minutes.

I plan to add to it approximately every 3 months (every time the memory on the weather station fills), and may break it apart into monthly CSV files after the single file gets unwieldy.

Note the *Time* column is in mm-dd-yyyy h:mm format.

Also in this repository is a visualization of indoor/outdoor temperatures as recorded in the CSV: http://waded.github.io/boise-weather/visualization/indoorvsoutdoor.html
