=============

This is a weather dataset I collected using a home weather station in the northwest Boise area (approximately Pierce Park & Castle.) I plan to add to it approximately every 3 months.

The initial reading is for January 5 2014, and has a granularity of 30 minutes.

Note that the time column is in DD-MM-YYYY format. I may change this later.
