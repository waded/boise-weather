=============

This is a weather dataset I collected using a home weather station (Anbient Weather WS-2080) in the northwest Boise area (approximately Pierce Park & Castle.)The initial reading is from January 5 2014, and has a granularity of 30 minutes.

I plan to add to it approximately every 3 months when the memory on the base station fills up.

Note the *Time* column is in DD-MM-YYYY format. I may change the format of this column later.
